Web scraping project with python

| This is my first web scraping project with python. I'm going to scrape match results from the **English Premier League** for this project. I'll download the data using a python library called **requests**, then parse it using beautiful soup to extract what I need, and finally load everything into a pandas data frame so I can clean it up and prepare it for analysis.
